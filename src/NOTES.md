# Base :: Geometric Properties & Examples

```typescript
 // 1. [001] rotateleft [010] flipright [100] flipforward from front where 1 is Math.PI
 // 2. Math.PI = 180deg so Math.PI * 2 = 360deg
 // The vector below Shows 3 circles on 3 axis which has intercepting circles.
 // together they are a sphereGeometry.
 var vec3: Vector3 = new Vector3(Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2, Math.PI / 2)
